1) load onto your computer... git clone

2) open a command window and navigate to directory

3) start webserver: cake/bin server

4) create a mysql database called 'canner'

5) mysql: source outside/db/buildDB2

6) open a browser with url: localhost:8765

 it may be a little bit complicated to get the first
 user into the database...

 the way i do it is like this:

 a) edit src/Controllers/UsersController.php

 b) find function 'login'
 
 c) uncomment the 6 commented lines

 d) fire up the application in the browser 

 d) on the login page - enter your new username/password

 e) then go back and comment out those 6 lines again

 f) and fire up the application and login with your new username/password...
